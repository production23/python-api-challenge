# WeatherPy & City Hotel Finder
##WeatherPy and City Hotel Finder are Python applications for weather and hotel information.
WeatherPy uses OpenWeatherMap API to visualize weather data, including temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed, against latitude. It performs linear regression and analyzes data for Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
City Hotel Finder utilizes Geoapify API to find nearby hotels within 10,000 meters of specified city coordinates. It displays cities on an interactive map, provides scatter plots, and lists nearby hotels alongside city names.
Both applications require Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook, and API keys from OpenWeatherMap and Geoapify. They are open to contributions and are licensed under the MIT License.
### Features

## WeatherPy

Fetches weather data for cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Visualizes weather variables such as temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed against latitude.
Computes linear regression for each relationship and visualizes it on the plots.
Separates plots into Northern and Southern Hemispheres for better analysis.

##City Hotel Finder
Finds hotels located within 10,000 meters of specified city coordinates using the Geoapify API.
Generates an interactive map displaying cities with markers and a scatter plot for visualization.
Lists nearby hotel names and countries alongside city names for easy reference.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenWeatherMap API key
- Geoapify API key
